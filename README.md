Very Important!!!! You need to create a file called keys.config. You can create this file by copying and renaming
the file keys_sample.config to keys.config and then updating the file with your keys. I have made the keys.config
file purposely to be ignored from being committed to protect against the sharing of private keys. All scripts use
the keys.config file so you only have to enter your keys in one location.
